# heteroprokaryotes
# This repository contains:

    1. Folder = DarwinMITgcm: Code and run files for Darwin-MITgcm ecosystem model for the heterotrophic prokaryote functional diversity project.
    2. Folder = GuildRA_16Sand18S: Plots of the RA of the 23 taxonomic guilds, from the three ocean transects, where the denominator is the full community (all 16S and 18S). There are 23*3 = 69 plots. There is also a PDF (GuildRA_16Sand18S_grouped.pdf) that shows these plots together, grouped by the biogeographical regions identified in the main text.
